This repository contains JavaScript functions illustrating decision-making processes using `if-else` and `switch` statements, alongside examples of recursion.
The `pricing(age)` function determines ticket prices based on age using a `switch` statement, while `clothingAdvice(temp, isRaining)` advises on clothing according to temperature and rain conditions with `if-else`.
The recursion functions include `fibbonacci(n)`, calculating Fibonacci numbers, and `palindrome(str)`, checking if a string is a palindrome. 
These concise and versatile functions can be easily integrated into projects or modified to suit various programming needs.
